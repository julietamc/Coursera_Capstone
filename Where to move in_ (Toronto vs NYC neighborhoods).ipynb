    "\n",
    "In these times of globalization is very usual that people moves from one city to another, even from one country to another for professional or academical reasons. For some, this decision is pleasant and a choice, but for some others is really hard and stressful. Leaving all the familiy, friends, traditions behind makes the task much more difficult. However, we could try to make this decision a bit easier by comparing multiple cities and find similarities of their neighborhoods in order to choose the one that will make you feel more comfortable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Between 1993 and 2013 USA was in the TOP 5 countries of immigration to Canada and Canada in the TOP 15 countries to USA. For this reason I find it representative to center the analysis in two cities: NYC and Toronto. So if you currently live in East Toronto, which NYC neighborhood would be the most suitable for you to move in? This is the question we will answer at the end of the analysis, but first let me walk you through all the steps of the project in this long journey from NYC to Toronto or viceversa."
